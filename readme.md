# EncoderHub Core

## Summary
EncoderHub is a .NET class library for encoding character sequences using various models. It's designed to be used independently of any presentation layer and is intended to be distributed as a NuGet package.

## Short-Term Goals
 - Have a well documented base to easily add encoding models to.
    - Create at least two simple encoders (one that runs locally, one that uses an API request) to demonstrate the workings of the platform
 - Create thorough tests for all classes
 - Package library as NuGet package, host it on GitHub Packages

## Long-Term Goals
 - Create CLI app
 - Create REST API endpoint
 - Create MAUI android/desktop app

## History
This library is developed as part of my university project laboratory.
